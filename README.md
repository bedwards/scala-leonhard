## Hello world

    % docker-compose exec scala bash
    # scala hello.scala
    Hello world.


## Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the
multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

    # scala One.scala 3 5 10
    23
